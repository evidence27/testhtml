    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p> When the construction site has been prepared,
                the fish pond and its water control structures can be built.
                This chapter shows you how to construct the fish pond,
                while the next chapters of this manual,
                deal with water control structures.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Dikes are the most important part of a fish pond,
                as they keep the necessary volume of water impounded and form the actual pond;
                their design and construction is particularly important.
                You will learn more about pond dikes and earthwork calculations in the next three sections,
                before learning how to stake out and construct the four main types of pond.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You will find it useful to have a notebook in which to make any calculations required and,
                if available, some squared or graph paper for sketching out and measuring pond and dike shapes.

    <h2>Characteristics of pond dikes</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            Any pond dike should have three basic qualities.

            <li>(a) It should be able to resist the water pressure resulting from the pond water depth.</li>

            <li>(b) It should be impervious, the water seepage through the dike being kept to a minimum.</li>

            <li>(c) It should be high enough to keep the pond water from ever running over its top, which would rapidly destroy
                the dike.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Resisting water pressure</h3>
    <p>Water pressure can be readily resisted by:
        anchoring your dike strongly to its foundations (the soil on which you build it);
        constructing your dike large enough to resist the water pressure by virtue of its weight.
    </p>
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>An intermediate dike separating two ponds may not need to be as strong as a perimeter dike,
        so long as the water pressure is more or less the same on both sides.
        If one pond needs to be drained while the adjacent one remains filled however,
        water pressures will be similar to those in perimeter dikes,
        and the dike should be stronger.
    </p>
    <h3>Ensuring impermeability</h3>
    <p>Impermeability of the dike can be ensured by:
        using good soil that contains enough clay (see Soil, 6);
        building a central clayey core when using pervious soil material;
        building a cut-off trench when the foundation is permeable;
        applying good construction practices (see Section 6.2);
        ensuring that the thickness of your dike is appropriate.
    </p>
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>a dike entirely built of good soil is said to be impervious when the upper limit of its wetted zone, the
        saturation line*,
        progresses through the dike so as to remain inside. The better the soil for dike construction, the more the
        saturation line is deflected downward,
        and the thinner the dike can be.
        The slope of this saturation line, the hydraulic gradient*, usually varies from 4:1 (clayey soil) to 8:1 (sandy
        soil).
        As shown, a clay core will affect this hydraulic gradient.
    </p>
    <h3>Choosing the right height</h3>
    <p>To calculate the height of the dike to be built, take into account:
        the depth of the water you want in the pond;
        the freeboard*, which is the upper part of a dike and should never be under water.
        It varies from 0.25 rn for very small diversion ponds to 1 m for barrage ponds without a diversion canal;
        the dike height that will be lost during settlement*,
        taking into account the compression of the subsoil by the dike weight and the settling of fresh soil material.
        This is the settlement allowance which usually varies from 5 to 20 percent of the construction height of the
        dike (see Section 6.2 and Table 28).
